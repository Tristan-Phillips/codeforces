    E. Expected Power
        time limit per test
            4 seconds
        memory limit per test
            256 megabytes

    You are given an array of n integers a1,a2,…,an. You are also given an array p1,p2,…,pn.
    Let S denote the random multiset (i. e., it may contain equal elements) constructed as follows:
        Initially, S is empty.
        For each i from 1 to n, insert ai into S with probability pi104. 
        Note that each element is inserted independently. 
        Denote f(S) as the bitwise XOR of all elements of S. 
        Please calculate the expected value of (f(S))2. 
        Output the answer modulo 109+7.
    
    Formally, let M=109+7. 
    It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction pq, 
    where p and q are integers and q≢0(modM). Output the integer equal to p⋅q−1modM. 
    In other words, output such an integer x that 0≤x<M and x⋅q≡p(modM).
    
    Input
        Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t(1≤t≤104). 
        The description of the test cases follows.
        The first line of each test case contains a single integer n(1≤n≤2⋅105).
        The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1023).
        The third line of each test case contains n integers p1,p2,…,pn (1≤pi≤104).
        It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.
    
    Output
        For each test case, output the expected value of (f(S))2, modulo 109+7.
